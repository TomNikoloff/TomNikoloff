# 👋 Hi, I'm Tom Nikoloff

I'm a full-stack developer based in the UK with 3+ years of hands-on experience building scalable, user-focused web applications. I started my development journey during lockdown and quickly transitioned from hobbyist to professional. By April 2022, I landed my first dev role and I’ve been all-in ever since.

## 🔧 What I Do

I work across the full stack but thrive in frontend development. Building intuitive, responsive UIs with clean architecture and thoughtful UX. I lead development on a fully custom CRM system, contribute to API and database layers, and am currently building a new factfind platform using **React**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **Express.js**.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React, Tailwind CSS, TypeScript, Styled Components, UIKit  
- **Backend**: PHP, Express.js, Firebase, SQLite  
- **Other Tools**: GitHub, Bitbucket, Netlify, GRAV CMS, Zoho Creator  
- **Practices**: Agile, Modular Architecture, Performance Optimisation
